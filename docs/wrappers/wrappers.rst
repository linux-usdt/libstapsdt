Wrappers
########

Here is a list of wrappers for other languages:

  * `Python <https://pypi.org/project/stapsdt/>`_
  * `NodeJS <https://www.npmjs.com/package/usdt>`_
  * `Go <https://github.com/mmcshane/salp>`_

Write your own wrapper
======================

``libstapsdt`` is written in C, which makes it very portable to almost any
language. Most dynamic languages provide a way to wrap C code. Feel free
to develop a wrapper in your language of choice. If you do, please let us know
to update our wrappers list!
